# Conveyor Sorting System (Factory I/O + CODESYS)
An automated conveyor sorting system that sorts items by height using Factory I/O and CODESYS.

## Features
- Sorts items using height sensors and actuators
- Built with Structured Text (ST)
- Fully simulated using Factory I/O

## ⚙️ How It Works

* A **feeder conveyor** introduces pallets carrying boxes onto the main conveyor line.
* Each box passes through a **height detection sensor** positioned above the conveyor.
* Based on the measured height:

  * **Tall boxes** are diverted to the **left side**.
  * **Short boxes** are diverted to the **right side**.
* At the end of each sorting line, a **sensor detects the presence of a pallet** and **increments a counter** to track the number of sorted items.
